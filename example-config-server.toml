# Oxidize Server Configuration Example
# Copy to /etc/oxidize/server.toml or ~/.config/oxidize/server.toml

# Server listens on 0.0.0.0:4433 by default (pass --listen to override)
# This config file controls behavior, not the listen address

# Maximum number of concurrent connections
# Recommended: 10000 per 4GB RAM
max_connections = 10000

# Enable LZ4 compression for data packets
# Trades CPU for bandwidth (usually worth it)
enable_compression = true

# Only compress payloads larger than this (bytes)
# Smaller packets have too much overhead
compression_threshold = 512

# Buffer size for packet reading/writing (bytes)
# Larger = better throughput, more memory
# Must be >= MTU (typically 1500)
buffer_size = 65536

# Send keepalive pings every N seconds
# Prevents NAT timeout, detects dead connections
keepalive_interval = 30

# Close idle connections after N seconds
# Balance between resource usage and reconnect overhead
connection_timeout = 300

# Enable TCP acceleration (immediate ACK)
# Reduces perceived latency for TCP flows
enable_tcp_acceleration = true

# Enable content deduplication
# Saves bandwidth when multiple users download same data
enable_deduplication = true

# TLS Certificate Configuration
# Leave commented to use self-signed certificates (development only)
# For production, generate real certificates with Let's Encrypt
# tls_cert_path = "/etc/oxidize/cert.pem"
# tls_key_path = "/etc/oxidize/key.pem"

# Rate Limiting
# Maximum requests per IP address within the time window
rate_limit_per_ip = 100

# Rate limit time window in seconds
rate_limit_window_secs = 60

# Mobile Tunnel settings for mobile client compatibility
# Generate config with: ./oxidize-server --generate-mobile-config
enable_mobile_tunnel = false
# mobile_tunnel_port = 51820

# ROHC (Robust Header Compression) - RFC 3095
# Compresses IP/UDP/TCP headers for bandwidth savings
# Best for: Gaming, VoIP, high packet-rate workloads
# Requires librohc to be installed (see docs/ROHC.md)
enable_rohc = true

# Maximum packet size for ROHC compression (bytes)
rohc_max_size = 1500

# === 0-RTT Session Resumption ===
# Enable 0-RTT for faster client reconnects (saves ~1 RTT)
# WARNING: 0-RTT is vulnerable to replay attacks. Only enable if you understand the risks.
# For VPN tunnels, this is generally safe as inner protocols handle replay protection.
enable_0rtt = false

# Maximum early data size in bytes for 0-RTT (default 16KB)
# Only used if enable_0rtt = true
max_early_data_size = 16384

# === AI/Heuristic Engine ===
# Enable AI-powered compression decisions using ML models
# When disabled, uses simple threshold-based compression
enable_ai_engine = true

# ============================================
# Performance Optimizations (Always Enabled)
# ============================================
# The following optimizations are always on:
# - Zero-copy buffer pooling (eliminates allocations)
# - Lock-free stream handling (no mutex on hot path)
# - ACK batching (8 per batch, reduces round-trips)
# - Latency instrumentation (µs-level timing)
