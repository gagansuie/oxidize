# Oxidize Client Configuration Example
# Copy to ~/.config/oxidize/client.toml
#
# Usage:
#   oxidize-client --server 1.2.3.4:4433 --config client.toml
#
# The server address is passed via CLI (not in this config file)

# Enable LZ4 compression for outgoing packets
enable_compression = true

# Only compress payloads larger than this (bytes)
compression_threshold = 512

# Buffer size for packet handling (bytes)
buffer_size = 65536

# Send keepalive pings to server every N seconds
keepalive_interval = 30

# Retry connection to server every N seconds after disconnect
reconnect_interval = 5

# Enable aggressive DNS prefetching
# Resolves likely next domains before you need them
enable_dns_prefetch = true

# Maximum DNS cache entries
dns_cache_size = 1000

# Maximum queued packets before dropping
# Higher = more memory, lower = packet loss under burst
max_packet_queue = 10000

# TUN interface MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
# Standard Ethernet = 1500, Jumbo frames = 9000
tun_mtu = 1500

# Enable header compression (experimental)
# Further reduces overhead for small packets
enable_header_compression = true
